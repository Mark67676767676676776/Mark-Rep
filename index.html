    <p style="color: darkred; font-family: comic code;"> After reading chapters 1-3 I think that it is interesting how a humanistic relationship can be created with an AI chatbot. The fact thatthe Ai felt so realistic to someone that they belived it was a real person is very concerning and it should definitly be further looked into. Which is why I also like how she learned from her mistake and instead of brushing past it she took time to study the matter further and warn others about this problem. </p>
